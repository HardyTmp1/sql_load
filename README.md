# INTRODUCTION 
 üìäThis project explores the most optimal skills for Data Analysts by analyzing job postings, salary data, and remote work availability. Using SQL, I examined which technical skillsüöÄ are both in high demand and associated with high-paying remote positionsüí∏. The goal is to identify strategic skillsüìà for career growth in data analyticsüé© by intersecting market demand and financial incentives.

# BACKGROUND
The data analytics job market is evolving rapidlyüöÄ, with employers increasingly seeking candidates proficient in a variety of technical tools and platformsüë®üèª‚Äçüíª. However, not all skills are equally valuable in terms of salary or job availability‚Äîespecially in a remote work settingüéØ.

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were : 

1. What are the top-paying Data Analyst job postings available for remote work?
2. Which skills are required for the top-paying Data Analyst positions?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for remote Data Analyst roles?
4. Which skills offer the highest average salaries for remote Data Analyst positions?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for remote Data Analyst careers (high demand + high salary)?
 



# TOOLS I USED 
For my deep dive into Data Analyst job market, I have used so many powerful skills including :

- **SQL :** I used SQL as the main language for querying and analyzing the job data. It allowed me to filter, join, group, and aggregate large datasets to uncover trends in salaries and skills.üî•
- **PostgreSQL :** PostgreSQL was the database system I used to store and manage structured job posting data. Its reliability and support for complex queries made it ideal for handling multi-table joins and subqueries.‚öôÔ∏è
- **Visual Studio Code :** VS Code provided a fast, customizable editor with SQL extensions (autocomplete, linting, snippets). This made writing, formatting, and testing multiple SQL scripts far more productive.üéØ
- **Git & Github :** I relied on Git for version control to track every change in my SQL files. Hosting on GitHub enabled easy collaboration, issue-tracking, and a clear history of how my analysis evolved.üîç


# THE ANALYSIS
This project centers around analyzing the remote job market for Data Analyst roles using SQL. My goal was to identify not just the highest-paying roles, but also the most in-demand and valuable skills associated with those jobs.
